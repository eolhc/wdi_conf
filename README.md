# [wdiCONF2k16](http://wdiCONF2K16.herokuapp.com/) by Team Platypus

Team Platypus likes to pair program and pair ping pong. We even rotated through pairing for all our ping pong doubles matches, so if that doesn't say something about the level of harmony and commitment in our group, then I don't know what will.

## What's Different

Ever seen a line-up for an event, whether a conference or music festival, and purchased tickets based on the attractive array of feature acts? Couple of months later, you realise that all these sessions clash. It's a wretched, sinking feeling, but don't worry, our conference, [wdiCONF2k16](http://wdiCONF2K16.herokuapp.com/), will not do that to you.

Before you purchase tickets on , "Curate your wdiCONF" allows you to plan the sessions that you wish to attend for the day. You can then purchase your ticket with our Stripe integration and return to a view of your customised itinerary.

## Example Flow

1. Create your itinerary at [wdiCONF2k16](http://wdiCONF2K16.herokuapp.com/) by dragging and dropping feature speakers into the interactive timetable
1. Select "Book Tickets" and complete all fields. Test purchasing of tickets using Stripe integration can be implmemented using Card No. 4242424242424242 and a future date as an expiry date. 
1. Upon successful payment, a confirmation of your itinerary will appear and a confirmation email will be sent to the email address provided.

## What We Learned

All of us actually learned how to implement jQueryUI, Stripe and Action Mailer together. We often connected the laptop to a projector to work through our problems pertaining to features we were all interested in integrating. jQueryUI was used for the drag and drop features of the interactive itinerary, Stripe for the payment integration and Action Mailer for the confirmation emails. Aside from that, we found pair programming particularly valuable when working through smaller problems.

## Where This Could Go

Future intentions are to implement touchscreen integration and to include the personalised itinerary within the confirmation email.
