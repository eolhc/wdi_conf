# wdiCONF2k16 by Team Platypus

Team Platypus likes to pair program and pair ping pong. We even rotated through pairing for all our ping pong doubles matches, so if that doesn't say something about the level of harmony and commitment in our group, then I don't know what will.


## Our Vision for [wdiCONF2k16](http://wdiCONF2K16.herokuapp.com/)

Ever seen a line-up for an event, whether a conference or music festival, and purchased tickets based on the attractive array of feature acts? Couple of months later, you attend the event and realise that everyone you wanted to see is showing simultaneously... That sucks. And [wdiCONF2k16](http://wdiCONF2K16.herokuapp.com/) does not do that to you.

Before you purchase tickets on , "Curate your wdiCONF" allows you to plan the sessions that you wish to attend for the day. You can then purchase your ticket with our Stripe integration and return to a view of your customised itinerary.

## Example

1. Create your itinerary at [wdiCONF2k16](http://wdiCONF2K16.herokuapp.com/).
